If the sample size is 400, the margin of error would be around 3.0 percentage points. However, if the sample size is increased to 1600, the margin of error would decrease to around 1.5 percentage points, assuming all other factors remain constant. This means that the larger sample size provides a more precise estimate of the population parameter, and the interval around the point estimate is narrower.\n",
